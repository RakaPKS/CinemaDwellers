# The Cinema Seating Problem
In this repository, you find all our code for both our Offline and Online solution.

More information on how to run all code can be found in the README within the respective directories [Offline](https://github.com/RakaPKS/CinemaDwellers/tree/master/Offline) and [Online](https://github.com/RakaPKS/CinemaDwellers/tree/master/Online). 

The code used to generate random and dense cinemas to analyze the offline problem is found in the directory [CinemaGenerator2000](https://github.com/RakaPKS/CinemaDwellers/tree/master/CinemaGenerator2000).
